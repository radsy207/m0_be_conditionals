# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? I feel like with more practice this will become easier. Currently making it through steadily with some difficulty.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? I feel confident enough to show my peers how to properly operate.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? Very confident
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? 1 hour (and an extra hour on spicy challenge)
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I need to practice everything. I do that once I'm finished with all time sensitive projects.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I am looking for a good online resource for questions like these (aside for slack) and will hopefully find that answer through my peers.
